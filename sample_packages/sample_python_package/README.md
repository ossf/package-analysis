## Sample Python package

This package will simulate different scenarios to test package analysis on. While this package will attempt to revert any modifications it makes, it is not recommended to install, import, or use this package in any way outside of a sandboxed setting.

To use this package for local analysis, build this package by running
`python3 -m build` in this directory. The package will be located in the dist/
folder.

Developers can modify which behaviors they want to simulate. (Collection of functionalities listed above main function in example.py) Note, however, that at this time output logging may not be comprehensive.

The same license for the rest of the package analysis project applies to this package.
