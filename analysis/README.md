# Configs and code to run analysis jobs

## Cluster

To access the cluster, run:

```shell
gcloud container clusters get-credentials analysis-cluster --zone=us-central1-c --project=ossf-malware-analysis
```

### Setup

Falco is installed with Helm, using the customrules file here.

```shell
helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts
helm repo update
kubectl create namespace falco
helm --namespace=falco install falco falcosecurity/falco -f customrules.yaml
```

We also build our own falco, to
[increase the ring buffer size](https://github.com/ossf/package-analysis/issues/10) used for
logging syscalls. The build script can be found in `../hacks/falco`.

Workload Identity is enabled for uploads to GCS.

## Deployment

The code in this directory is deployed with ko:

```
ko apply -f config/
```

## Analysis

The two scripts in this repo can be run directly:

```shell
./python-runner.sh
./node-runner.sh
```

To clean up, run:

```shell
kubectl delete pod -l install=1
```
